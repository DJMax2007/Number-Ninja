# Number Ninja

This Python script generates a list of numbers within a specified range, with options to exclude multiples of a number, include only multiples of a number, exclude prime numbers, or include only prime numbers. It then displays the list, the count of numbers, or both, and optionally calculates the sum of the numbers.

## Short Description

A versatile number generator and manipulator that allows users to define a range, filter by multiples and primality, and display results in various ways.

## Features

*   **Range Input:** Takes starting and ending numbers as input, ensuring the ending number is greater than the starting number.  Handles non-numeric input.
*   **Multiple Exclusion/Inclusion:** Allows the user to exclude or include multiples of a specific number.
*   **Prime Number Handling:** Provides options to exclude or include only prime numbers within the range.
*   **Display Options:**  Lets the user choose to display the list of numbers, the count of numbers, or both.
*   **Sum Calculation:** Offers an option to calculate and display the sum of the numbers in the generated list.
*   **Input Validation:** Robust input validation to ensure correct data types and prevent errors.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear prompts and messages to guide the user.
*   **Restart/Exit:** Options to restart the process or exit the program.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x

## How to Use

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `number_machine.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Run the script using the command: `python number_machine.py`
4.  Follow the prompts to enter the starting and ending numbers, choose filtering options, and select the display format.

## Example

```bash
$ python number_machine.py
